   > stress(& longer) content words (Action verbs(teach,sing), Nouns, adjectives(big,small), adverbs(quickly,fast), WH Questions Words(who,what), and Negatives(no,never).) . if you remove content words sentence will not make any sense. 
   > Don't stress(& softer) structure words(prepositions(in,on), pronouns(it,she),articles, modals(can,could), helping verbs(be,do).) . if you remove them sentence will still make sense.

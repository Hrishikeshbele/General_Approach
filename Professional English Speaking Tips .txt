1. Small Talks : 
   > greetings(opening line,self introduction) + topic discussion(ask qtns ,listen carefully, show interest) . popular topics : hobbies , family , news, native place , sports .
   ex. p1 : hello! my name is hrishikesh . what's your name ? p2: hello, i am sam p1 : nice to meet you,sam . this is great event,isn't it ?what brings you here  p2:i am here for work and you ?
       p1: what king of work you do ? p2: tech analyst p1 : so you're in tech?what do you think about my new phone ? p2 : wow, it's really great. p1: have you tried new restaurant across street ? p2 : no but heard a lot about it .  p1: i would really like to try it . would you like to join me ?
       
2. stress and intonation : 
   > stress(& longer) content words (Action verbs(teach,sing), Nouns, adjectives(big,small), adverbs(quickly,fast), WH Questions Words(who,what), and Negatives(no,never).) . if you remove content words sentence will not make any sense. 
   > Don't stress(& softer) structure words(prepositions(in,on), pronouns(it,she),articles, modals(can,could), helping verbs(be,do).) . if you remove them sentence will still make sense.
   > intonation (rising and lowering voice) : at the end of sentence
